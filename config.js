"<p>The WNAH supports disaster preparedness by leveraging the power of open mapping and data to build resilient communities. The hub collaborates with local volunteers, organizations, and governments through participatory mapping initiatives to generate geospatial data critical for emergency response and disaster preparedness. By mapping vulnerable areas, infrastructure, and key resources, the initiative ensures that first responders and decision-makers have the information they need to act swiftly and effectively. This approach not only strengthens disaster resilience but also empowers communities to actively safeguard their environments through open, accessible mapping technologies.</p" +
"<p>Despite these efforts, many disaster-prone areas remain unmapped, creating significant data gaps on communities and infrastructure. These gaps hinder response efforts, disrupt service delivery, and ultimately contribute to loss of life.</p>" +
"<p>The <strong>Regional Disaster and Preparedness Project</strong> (RDPR) focused on investigating disasters that occurred in the West and Northern Africa region during the last decade, notably from 2014 to 2023. The report is based on data collected through desk research and phone interviews with national-level stakeholders.</p>" +
"<p>The findings provide WNAH with strategic guidance in prioritizing areas for open participatory mapping in disaster preparedness by identifying high-risk areas, data gaps, and community needs. This insight ensures that mapping efforts are directed toward the most critical locations. These will also help WNAH allocate resources efficiently, engage local stakeholders, and expand access to critical geospatial data to support disaster response and resilience-building initiatives.</p>"

"<p>Between 2014 and 2023, the WNAH experienced extreme natural events, primarily heavy rainfalls, flooding, storms, landslides, and occasional volcanic eruptions. These disasters led to widespread destruction, affecting millions of people through displacement, casualties, and economic losses. Countries such as Nigeria, Côte d'Ivoire, Cameroon, and Ghana were frequently impacted, with floods being the most recurrent hazard. In addition to the physical damage to homes, schools, and infrastructure, some events triggered secondary crises like cholera outbreaks, especially in Cameroon and Sierra Leone.</p>" +
"<p>The deadliest years were 2019 and 2022, with millions affected, thousands of casualties, and vast agricultural losses. The period saw significant increases in displacement and destruction, particularly in 2022. The disasters also affected vital infrastructure, including water and sanitation systems, roads, and health facilities, further exacerbating humanitarian challenges. </p>"+
"<p>By 2023, the trend continued, with Morocco experiencing a rare earthquake and widespread flooding affecting multiple countries. The cumulative impact highlights the region's vulnerability to climate-related disasters and the urgent need for resilience-building measures.</p>"
